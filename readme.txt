== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=How to setup new APP in Mautic for gettings connection keys?=

Please refer to the APP setup section of connect page in plugin. You will find a link to APP setup and from there you can follow the steps to setup a new APP in mautic.

=Getting problems in creating Mautic custom fields. What should i do?=

From the last few responses from our users/clients, we came to know of this common issue **"Something went wrong, Please try again later!"** while creating the custom fields in mautic. These issues have been because of mautic configuration and permission setup on the server.
But no worries. We have just come up with a solution to this.

Please follow the steps as described:
1) One of the **"annotations"** folder on mautic should be writable in order to make custom fields. Please navigate to the folder where the mautic has been setup and follow this path:
path -to-mautic/app/cache/prod/ and make the annotation file writable. Set the permission as 777.

2) After this the mautic cache has to be clear.

There are several ways to do that. The easiest is to go to the /app/cache folder and delete its content.

`Through terminal command`: navigate to the folder where the mautic has been setup and then run the following command- `php app/console cache:clear`

For more tips and knowledge about the Mautic, you can also refer to the following [link](https://www.mautic.org/docs/en/index.html)


=What should I do? I can't see the API Credentials section in Mautic.=

If your Mautic doesn't show up API Credentials section in side menu then please make sure that API is enabled in your mautic account. The same can be achieved from **Settings > Configuration > API Settings**.Please mark the API enabled checkbox to **"YES"** and your Mautic account will be enabled for API.


=Why the plugin is not getting redirected back and showing some Mautic error?=

Please make sure you are using correct Mautic base URL and connection keys for authorization. Make sure that the redirect URI set in Mautic APP is same as your wordpress URL( or you can copy the Redirect URI from the APP setup guide directly ).

=Real time user data in not syncing properly. Why?=

Please make sure you have completed the fields setup for the plugin. The real time sync will be done in every 5 minutes so make sure that you wait for that much time. Also please assure the wordpress cron is enabled on your site and works properly.

=I am new to Mautic. How can I get Mautic to download?=

Mautic is an open source crm and can be easily downloaded from [Mautic.org](https://www.mautic.org/download/)

=Custom fields are created but contacts are not syncing over mautic?=

Please check your mautic version. The latest release of mautic i.e. Version 2.15.1 has some issues with custom multi select fields. Please check for multi select fields in mautic dashboard and turn them off also disable the same field from plugin settings. The contact syncing should work fine after that.
